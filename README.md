# **readMeGenerator**
![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/inquirer)

#### **Description:**

This code uses inquirer NPM to generate ReadMe files by running index.js using node in the terminal.  Although we were not asked for it, I also used axios to display the number of repositories the user has on Github.  This information is just console logged and I did not include it in the readMe generator output.  

It is run in the terminal by typing node index.js.  

Here is what was required in the homework:
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
- THEN a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions 
- WHEN I enter my project title
- THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
- WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
- THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
- WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
- THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
- WHEN I enter my GitHub username
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
- WHEN I enter my email address
- THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
- WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
- THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

The project meets all of these requirements and does not have a bug.  In addition to the minimal requirements, there is a check that I added in every prompt to ensure that the user has entered data and will not let the user progress without entering text.
